I started work on the [ThriftyField]() project last November after watching some old videos from [Chezy Champs](). I was amazed by 254's field software, and wanted to build my own. As I do with all my ideas, I created a github repo, made a few commits with some half-working code and some notes, the forgot about it.

ThriftyField would have been completely forgotten about had I not been asked by a member of [6856]() to help them with the creation of their practice field (Currently just an idea. Not reality yet). I immeadiatly said "Sure!" and started work on ThriftyField 3.0
